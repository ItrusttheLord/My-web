          "The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those
          living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned." — Isaiah 9:2
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          This is more than a purchase. It’s a statement. A journey. A
          reflection of something deeper.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Through struggle, uncertainty, and the weight of the unknown, we walk.
          The darkness is real. The obstacles feel endless. But within every
          moment of hardship, there is a light waiting to break through.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The design you wear is a symbol of that transformation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "Ad Astra Per Tenebras"—a declaration that greatness is found beyond
            trials.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Tenebris Vivo, Lux Renascor"—"I live in darkness, but I am reborn
            in light."
          </li>
          <li>
            A figure emerging from the void, surrounded by flowing
            energy-reminder that every step through darkness brings you closer
            to the stars.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
          Thank you for being part of this vision. You’re not just wearing a
          design—you’re carrying a message of resilience, transformation, and
          faith.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          May this piece remind you that no matter how deep the shadows are,
          light always finds a way through.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Welcome to the movement. This is just the beginning.</p>
